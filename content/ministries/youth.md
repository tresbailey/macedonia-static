Our teenagers desire to be loved, accepted, and live life with a purpose.  I Timothy 4:12, tells youth, “Don’t let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in life, in love, in faith and in purity.”   Our hope for our students is that they will experience God’s love, develop a better understanding of God’s work, and then live out what they have learned daily.  Our ministry is designed to encourage our students as they grow toward spiritual maturity. Through our Sunday Morning  Sunday School classes, year-round ministries, weekly missions activities, or our annual Impact Weekend, our focus is to teach our teens how to be disciples for Christ in their home, schools,  and communities, and to help them share with everyone they meet along the way..
