Nursery – Our church provides a nursery for babies and toddlers through age two during all regularly-scheduled services giving parents an opportunity to experience and enjoy the worship services with the assurance that their children are being cared for by carefully selected church members. Upon check-in at the nursery, family members are given a beeper which will be used to notify parents if they are needed at any time.

Children’s Church – On Sunday mornings, Children’s Church for ages three through five is available during both services. Children learn and fellowship in an age-appropriate environment through Bible lessons, singing, and craft time.

Sonshine Choir (Wednesday 6:30-6:45) (Ages 2-4) The Sonshine Choir is a great opportunity for little ones to learn about God through music!

Children’s Choir (Wednesday 6:00-6:45) (Grades K-5) The children’s choir program provides an opportunity for children to develop music skills and to worship God through music. Children share their music in worship services and special seasonal programs.
