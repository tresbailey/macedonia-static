My calling from God has given me the opportunity to touch the world and share eternity. In the years of my ministry at Macedonia, I have had the privilege of reaching out to the ends of the earth, and also to the ends of the pew in the name of Christ. This ministry is still exciting because I believe God is opening the greatest doors of opportunity in the history of our church. What is this opportunity? For those who are searching for meaning, Christ is our Wonderful Counselor. For those who are weak and in need, the Lord is our Mighty God. For those who are searching for hope, He is our Eternal God, and for those who are drowning in the chaos of the world, He is our Prince of Peace. In our world where so many have lost their way, as a minister I have the opportunity to share with them the Savior.
