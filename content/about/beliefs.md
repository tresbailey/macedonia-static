Summary: At Macedonia, our beliefs are based on The Bible

## The Scriptures

We believe the Holy Bible is the Word of God written by men divinely inspired and is the sole authority for life and faith. It has God for its author, salvation for its end, and truth, without any mixture of error, for its matter. Therefore, all Scripture is true and trustworthy. It reveals the principles by which God judges us, and therefore is, and will remain to the end of the world as the standard by which all human conduct and religious opinions should be tried.

## God

We believe there is one and only one true God who exists in the eternal triune (three persons); the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, with distinct personal attributes, but without division of nature, essence, or being.

## God the Father

God as Father reigns with providential care over His universe, His creatures, and human history according to the purposes of His grace. God is Father in truth to those who become children of God through faith in Jesus Christ.

## God the Sun

Christ is the eternal Son of God. In His incarnation as Jesus Christ, He was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary. He lived a sinless life, died in our place as a sacrifice for the sins of mankind, was buried, arose bodily from the grave, and ascended into Heaven, and will return to earth some day.

## God the Holy Spirit

Christ is the eternal Son of God. In His incarnation as Jesus Christ, He was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary. He lived a sinless life, died in our place as a sacrifice for the sins of mankind, was buried, arose bodily from the grave, and ascended into Heaven, and will return to earth some day.

## Man

We believe that man is a special creation of God, made in His own image, but that through the sin of the first man, Adam, mankind fell so that all men are sinners and need salvation. Since God created man in His own image, and since Christ died for man, every person of every race possesses dignity and is worthy of respect and Christian love.

## Salvation

We believe that salvation is offered freely to all who repent and accept by faith Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, who by His own blood obtained eternal redemption for the believer.

## Assurance

We believe that every person who is truly saved by being born of the Spirit through faith in Christ has the assurance, or confidence, of salvation and is eternally secure in Christ. This assurance of eternal security is not based on the work or the worth of the individual, but is based entirely on the testimony and promise of God in the scriptures. God will never reject those who are his own, because of His character, promises, grace and power.

## The Church

We believe that the church is an autonomous local congregation of baptized believers, associated by covenant in the faith and fellowship of the gospel, observing the two ordinances of Christ, exercising the gifts, rights, and privileges invested in them by His Word, and seeking to extend the gospel to the ends of the earth. Each congregation operates under the Lordship of Christ through democratic processes. In such a congregation each member is responsible and accountable to Christ as Lord.

## Baptism and The Lord's Supper

We believe that Christian baptism is the immersion of a believer in water as a one-time act of obedience symbolizing the believer’s faith in a crucified, buried, and risen Savior, the believer’s death to sin, the burial of the old life, and the resurrection to walk in the newness of life in Christ Jesus. Only those persons who profess a personal faith in Jesus Christ may be baptized.

We believe the Lord’s Supper is a symbolic act of obedience whereby Christians memorialize the death of the Redeemer and anticipate the second coming. The Lord’s Supper is to be celebrated regularly as a memorial in remembrance of Christ’s death on the cross, and in expectation of His return. The elements of the Lord’s Supper represent the body and blood of Christ and are available to all believers who have confessed their sins to God.

## Prayer

We believe that each believer has direct access to God through the Lord Jesus Christ.

## Evangelism and Missions

We believe it is the duty and privilege of every follower of Christ and every church of the Lord Jesus Christ to endeavor to make disciples of all nations … to seek constantly to win the lost to Christ by verbal witness undergurded by a Christian lifestyle, and by other methods in harmony with the gospel of Christ.

## Religious Liberty

We believe in the separation of church and state. A free church in a free state is the Christian ideal. We believe that Christians should be salt and light in society.
